        "For many travelers, Kerala is South India's most serenely beautiful state. This slender coastal strip is defined by its layered landscape: almost 373 miles (600km) of glorious Arabian Sea coast and beaches; a languid network of glistening backwaters; and the spice- and tea-covered hills of the Western Ghats, dotted with fiercely protected wildlife reserves and cool hill stations such as Munnar. Just setting foot on this swathe of soul-soothing, palm-shaded green will slow your subcontinental stride to a blissed-out amble. Kerala is a world away from the hectic action of the rest of India, its long, fascinating backstory illuminated by historically evocative cities like Kochi (Cochin) and Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum)..",

        "A dosa is a thin savory crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew).[1] Dosas are popular in South Asia as well as around the world.Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars or saturated fats. As its key ingredients are rice and black gram, it is a good source of protein.[16] A typical homemade plain dosa without oil contains about 112 calories, of which 84% is carbohydrate and 16% protein.[17] The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content.",

        "Silky-sand Goa and backwater-laced Kerala are the country’s beach queens, but there are plenty of other seductive Indian sands worth seeking out. The fast-growing surf scene will delight travelers keen to ride the waves; diving, snorkeling, kayaking, paddleboarding and countless other water sports cater to active souls; and there are endless opportunities for toes-in-the-sand sun salutations in the birthplace of yoga.Although local clean-up initiatives are on the rise, India’s ongoing beach-pollution issues often mean plastic and toxic waste washing up across the country. Do your bit by exploring responsibly, supporting sustainably run businesses and joining beach-cleaning projects. These are India’s best beaches.",

        "The impact of psychology on art investigates what artists knew about the psychology of perception and how they applied this knowledge, from the late eighteenth century onwards. Topics include the impact of theories colour mixture and harmony on Seurat and the Bauhaus; and Whistler’s interest in peripheral vision.How psychology explains artistic perception examines why paintings deviate from norms of perspectival space and colour constancy. It addresses the Pre-Raphaelites’ and Impressionists’ depiction of coloured shadows; and so-called ‘distortions’ in the work of Cezanne with reference to theories of vision for action and holistic face perception.How pictures work analyses the projection systems artists use to map space, and the physical marks they employ to render corresponding features of scenes. Drawing on neuroscience and transformational generative grammar, it examines how some artists, such as van Gogh, employed projection and marks in unconventional ways, to poetic effect.",
